Watch the Oscars this Sunday to find out if “Meryl Streep will win best actress in a leading role!”  #FullSailOscars #FSSMC
Best Actress - Will win: Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine). Should win: Judi Dench (Philomena). #Oscars
Rooting for Judi Dench to win Best Actress coz i'm a fan.. But Cate Blanchett will probably win. #Oscars
I predict #Gravity will win 8 #Oscars including best picture and best actress for Sandra Bullock #Oscars2014
Best Actress:
Should win- Sandra Bullock
Will win- Cate Blanchett #oscars
I wouldn't say Sandra Bullock will win Best Actress though - too strong competition and she mainly hyperventilates in the film #Oscars
@MingNa Lupita will win! However, I'm think Dallas Buyers Club will get Best Picture. Sandra Bullock will get Best Actress. #Oscars

Best Actress: Who will win - Cate Blanchette. Who should win - Sandra Bullock. Woody gets actresses #oscars. M*
According to some fancy psychic, Sandra Bullock will win the Best actress award on Sunday. (Even though Cate is poised to win) #oscars
Best Actress:
Should win- Sandra Bullock
Will win- Cate Blanchett #oscars
Gravity will win the most awards. Original screenplay will go to Her. Best actress to Cate Blanchett and (I pray) best actor to Leo #Oscars
They're saying Cate Blanchett will win Best Actress. 

I think that'll turn out to be Bullock's
